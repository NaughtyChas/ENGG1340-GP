## Usage of AI and Plagiarism

Github Copilot is visible in the collaborator list, we use AI responsibly. Github Copilot is only being used for Pull Requests auto-review, it will only give suggestions for potential points of improvements, not code generation, helping us to write more robust code. Consider this as CodeQL powered by AI.

See more about this new feature [here](https://docs.github.com/zh/copilot/using-github-copilot/code-review/using-copilot-code-review).
