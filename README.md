## DESCRIPTION FOR THE GAME ##
* Title: „Ää ***Rebirth : Me Delivering Keeta in Doomsday*** „Äã
* Background Story:
  -   One minute, you were just a normal student, bored out of your mind in class, scrolling through your phone and ordering "Keeta Takeout". The next minute‚Äî _BOOM_. Your brain short-circuited. The world went black......\
      You woke up to the sound of the earth splitting open, your face pressed against cracked asphalt, the sky a sickly shade of blood-red, with strange walls and obstacles rising everywhere.\
    "What the‚Äî?!"\
      Cities crumbled, governments fell, and the remnants of humanity scattered into the wastelands, fighting for survival against mutated horrors, rogue machines, and the most serious problem-resource supply.\
      Your phone buzzes violently in your pocket. You pull it out with trembling hands, a notification appear:\
      There is a map shown the location of packages and delivery location.\
    "Packages remaining today: 3"\
      That‚Äôs when you notice the uniform clinging to your body‚Äîneon orange, with the Keeta logo smeared. Every parcel is a fragile heartbeat in the chest of the apocalypse for life.\
    Move. Move! Time waits for noone. Every second wasted is another name crossed off the list. Your lungs scream, your muscles burn‚Äîkeep running.
* Brief Introduction:
